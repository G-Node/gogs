## Purpose

The goal of this project is to make the easiest, fastest, and most painless way of setting up a self-hosted Git service. With Go, this can be done with an independent binary distribution across **ALL platforms** that Go supports, including Linux, Mac OS X, Windows and ARM.

## Overview

- Please see the [Documentation](https://gogs.io/docs/intro) for common usages and change log.
- Want to try it before doing anything else? Do it [online](https://try.gogs.io/gogs/gogs)!
- Having trouble? Get help with [Troubleshooting](https://gogs.io/docs/intro/troubleshooting.html) or [User Forum](https://discuss.gogs.io/).
- Want to help with localization? Check out the [guide](https://gogs.io/docs/features/i18n.html)!

## Hardware Requirements

- A Raspberry Pi or $5 Digital Ocean Droplet is more than enough to get you started. Some even use 64MB RAM Docker [CaaS](https://blog.docker.com/2016/02/containers-as-a-service-caas/).
- 2 CPU cores and 512MB RAM would be the baseline for teamwork.
- Increase CPU cores when your team size gets significantly larger, memory footprint remains low.

## Browser Support

- Please see [Semantic UI](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI#browser-support) for specific versions of supported browsers.
- The smallest resolution officially supported is **1024*768**, however the UI may still look right in smaller resolutions, but no promises or fixes.
