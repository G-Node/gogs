# Contributing to Gogs

> This guidelines sheet is forked from [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/drone/drone/blob/8d9c7cee56d6c2eac81dc156ce27be6716d97e68/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Gogs is not perfect, and it has bugs or incomplete features in rare cases. You're welcome to tell us, or to contribute some code. This document describes details about how can you contribute to Gogs project.

## Contribution guidelines

Depends on the situation, you will:

- Find a bug and create an issue
- Need more functionality and make a feature request
- Want to contribute code and open a pull request
- Run into issue and need help

### Bug Report

If you find something you consider a bug, please create a issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/G-Node/gogs/issues). To avoid wasting time and reduce back-and-forth communication with team members, please include at least the following information in a form comfortable for you:

- Bug Description
- Gogs Version
- Git Version
- System Type
- Error Log
- Other information

Please take a moment to check that an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/G-Node/gogs/issues) doesn't already exist documenting your bug report or improvement proposal. If it does, it never hurts to add a quick "+1" or "I have this problem too". This will help prioritize the most common problems and requests.

#### Bug Report Example

Gogs crashed when creating a repository with a license, using v0.5.13.0207, SQLite3, Git 1.9.0, Ubuntu 12.04.

Error log:

```
2014/09/01 07:21:49 [E] nil pointer
```

### Feature Request

There is no standard form of making a feature request. Just try to describe the feature as clearly as possible, because team members may not have experience with the functionality you're talking about.

### Pull Request

Please read detailed information on [Wiki](https://github.com/G-Node/gogs/wiki/Contributing-Code).

### Ask For Help

Before opening an issue, please make sure your problem isn't already addressed on the [Troubleshooting](https://gogs.io/docs/intro/troubleshooting.html) and [FAQs](https://gogs.io/docs/intro/faqs.html) pages.
