/*
Package libgin provides functionality for features added for the G-Node GIN service.
This is a temporary package. Functions and types have been copied from gin-doi and gin-dex services. The plan is for G-Node/GOGS (GIN) to not depend on any code from the added services. Instead, common functionality will be imported from a separate lib package. This subpackage is the first version of that.
